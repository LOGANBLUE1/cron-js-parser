# cron-js-parser
Library that provides two methods which help in UI and Backend based parsing for parses of cron expression. Following **methods** are found to be most common use cases, also culprits which bloat the code : 
1. ***parseHumanReadable***:

    Outputs a human readable description of the cron schedule from a cron expression or cron values. For example, given the expression "*/5 * * * *" it will output "Every 5 minutes". 

2. ***parseCronExpression***:

## Support
* Quartz Scheduler
* Javascript
* Typescript
* Nodejs
* Browser
